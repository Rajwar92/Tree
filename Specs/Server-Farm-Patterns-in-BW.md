# Overview

Server farm patterns are used in BorderWise to identify machine IDs of users that belong to a given organization. They are employed when users access BorderWise through server farm.

Administrators of organizations that use server farms are encouraged to install the WTG Machine Identification Service ([Download link](https://myaccount-portal.cargowise.com/my-account/downloads/WiseTechMachineIdentificationService.msi)) on their server farm machines.

# Managing Server Farm Patterns

Server farm patterns are managed in UMP under the 'Organization' tab. This is accessible to organization administrators.
