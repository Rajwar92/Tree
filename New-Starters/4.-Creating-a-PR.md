## Branch names

Please include WI number and summary in the branch name: `${Link-from-ediProd}`
If there are multiple coding workflows - include the workflow name as well: `${Link-from-ediProd} - {Workflow-Description}`

1. Copy WI link from ediProd: Actions -> Copy Hyperlink to Clipboard (`Ctrl + H`)
1. Create a new branch in VS Code: `Ctrl + Shift + P` -> `Git: Create Branch...`
1. Enter your staff code and `/`, like so: `MMZ/`
1. Paste what you copied from ediProd
1. VS Code will automatically replace spaces with `-`
1. (if working on multiple coding workflows) add ` - ` and paster workflow name as well

The benefit is that we can more easily switch between branches without having to remember WI numbers and using keywords instead.

For example:
- Staff code: `MMZ`
- WI number: `WI00525665`
- WI summary: `WW. Generic API support`
- Workflow Description: `Dev - Field Child Components`
- Branch name entered in VS Code: `MMZ/WI00525665 - WW. Generic API support - Dev - Field Child Components`
- Branch name after auto-conversion: `MMZ/WI00525665---WW.-Generic-API-support---Dev---Field-Child-Components`

## PR Name

Same as for branches, make sure it includes the WI number and summary: `${Link from ediProd}`
Include Workflow Description if there are multiple coding workflows: `${Link from ediProd} - {Workflow Description}`

For example:
- WI number: `WI00525665`
- WI summary: `WW. Generic API support`
- Workflow Description: `Dev - Field Child Components`
- PR Name: `WI00525665 - WW. Generic API support - Dev - Field Child Components`

## Draft PR

To keep PRs list nice and tidy, as well as to protect from accidental merges, unless your PR is ready for reviews, create it as a Draft:

If you already created PR and want to convert it to a draft:

Then once it's ready:
