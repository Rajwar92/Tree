Below are the questions asked by our Product Managers and the answers from our TARIC (Spanish) Team.

**1.	What source are you collecting the data for EU Measures?**
We are collection from multiple sources. But the main is the NL Customs, that have been proved to be more reliable and complete than the EU Commission or similar EU member state sources. We also collect EU data from BE, SE and PL, which is useful for comparison and as fallback in case we have any problem with NL. On the other hand, we are using the EU Commision source for translations, they are not as reliable as the other sources, but it's not a big problem to have some fields not translated in time if the data integrity is good.

**2.	How frequently are the EU Measures updated in the original source?**
Considering the original source the EU Commission, they publish daily updates. NL Customs also publish daily updates with the same data, but better.
3.	What language(s) are the measure available and collected in from original source you are collecting the data from?
The EU Commission publish data in every official member state language. The NL Customs, like many EU Customs, publish the data in English and their official local languages, in this case, Dutch.

**4.	How frequently are you collecting the EU Measures and updating your database in comparison to the how frequently the EU Measures are updated in the original source?**
On a daily basis, we collect the data that the sources publish during the day at night (CET) and update the internal database of our data gathering system. So each day we have the most recent information from the day before. In the data system we perform automated data integrity checks and also we allow our product team to manually review the new included data. Once data is validated we release data to our production systems.

Nowadays we are releasing data once per week on Monday or Tuesday, or any other day if the nomenclature or some critical change is published from the source. We have to remember that we publish future data, so, most of the information is received in advance and is available before its effective date. But in any case, as we improve our automatic data verification processes, we expect to accelerate the release cadence

**5.	What is the delay from the original EU Measures updated data to availability for BorderWise to extract/download?**
At the same time that we prepare the data for TariffOne, we also prepare and publish the data bundle that BorderWise uses.
