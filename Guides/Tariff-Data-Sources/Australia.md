Australia uses different Tariffs for Import & Export: Schedule-3 and AHECC.

**Schedule-3**
There two sources that we use to build Schedule-3:
- Word documents that AU Customs sends us via email, and
- AU Customs website: https://www.abf.gov.au/importing-exporting-and-manufacturing/tariff-classification/current-tariff/schedule-3

We usually know in advance when tariff changes are going to occur and ask Customs to send us updated Word files - so that we can preemptively build & test BWW's Schedule-3.

The website will publish the changes after their effective date, so it can only be used as a backup source. We also do a cross-comparison of the Word files vs the website to identify data discrepancies.

**AHECC (Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification)**
We collect AHECC from the ABS website:
https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/classifications/australian-harmonized-export-commodity-classification-ahecc/latest-release

It's a collection of Excel files: 21 sections, Summary and Key of Changes. Each file Section file contains "chapter" tabs for Legal Notes and Nomenclature.
