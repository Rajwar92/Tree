New Zealand uses the same tariff for Import and Export.

We receive tariff updates from NZ Customs via email, usually one or two weeks prior to the updates' effective date. This gives us a head start to build and validate NZ Tariff - and send anomalies back to NZ Customs.

NZ Tariff (aka NZ Working Tariff Document, NZWTD) is a set of PDF files, also available on the NZCS website: https://www.customs.govt.nz/business/tariffs/working-tariff-document/

_Question: Why can't we use the files from the website?
Answer: We can - but we use email updates simply because they are sent to us well in advance._

The Tariff file-set is composed of 21 "Section" files + accompanying files (Introduction, Valid Pages, etc.) To build the data for BorderWise, we only need the "Section" files.

One peculiarity of NZ Tariff files to be aware of: they are typeset for printing, e.g. they use ligatures, kerning, gutters, etc. All this complicates the process of converting PDF to JSON.
