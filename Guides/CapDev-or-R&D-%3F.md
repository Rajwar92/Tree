Remember that we usually treat WIs as defects if the functionality has already been released to users and it's not working as it used to before.

Examples of NOT defects:
- functionality is in master branch but not available to customers => not defect better to classify as a refactor
- functionality is not working as expected but it has never worked this way => product enhancement
