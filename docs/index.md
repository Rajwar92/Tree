# What do I do when I get stuck on a problem? 
It is very normal to get stuck on issues in software development, and you will continue to get stuck on things throughout your career (such is the nature of software engineering!). Luckily, you have many tools and steps you can use in these situations. Listed below are 5 cards that you can follow when you find yourself so:
- Card 1: [Stack Overflow Posts](https://wisetechglobal.sharepoint.com/sites/StackOverflow) / Google / Wiki. If you have trouble building something, if you're encountering problems for the first time or if you're even just stuck on general c# queries. Paste that error code into the search bar of stack overflow / google / the wiki and see if you can find something. Sometimes its crazy to see how many people have encountered the same problem you have and there's detailed answers to some of the more common problems. Unfortunately, we no longer have stack overflow at WiseTech, but all the old posts can be found [here](https://wisetechglobal.sharepoint.com/sites/StackOverflow). 
- Card 2: Ask your fellow E&L mentees. There is a good chance they may have come across the issue in the past, or know of some helpful debugging techniques that you might be able to try. Teaching others is one of the best ways to learn so this is also a good chance for them to consolidate what they know if they have come across something similar before.
- Card 3: If you can't find an answer to your question, it's a good idea to post a question in your team's general help channel. Someone should get back to you soon, and your question could help someone else later too. Or who knows, you might run into the same problem later and your own post might help you when you've forgotten the solution. In BorderWise, we have project specific channels (BW gang, WW squad, UMP crew) so that you can post in the channel relevant to the project you have the issue on. Message your mentor to add you to the channel if you are not already part of one. 
- Card 4: Ask your mentor! We are here to help you at any time.
- Card 5: Ask someone else on your team, chances are they'll be able to help you too. And if they can't they'll refer you to someone else who can help you.

# A guide to asking questions well

When asking questions, it is important to communicate clearly in order to save you and the person you are asking the question of time. This can save you a lot of back and forth. The following structure is one I like to following when asking questions.

- PR link
- WI link
- Summary of what the WI is / general question context
- My question
- Steps I have tried so far to try solve the problem
- What I've understood / gathered from my debugging or investigation

Adding these elements to your question means that the person you are asking has all the information at their fingertips they need to answer your question, and that they can tailor their response in a way that matches your understanding and fills in any knowledge gaps you might have in the area.
